# COP4516-AS1

This program demonstrates a multi-threaded approach to a computationally intensive task (finding primes up to 10^8) and showcases how to divide such a task among multiple threads for improved performance.

I have created test cases to find primes between 1 and 64 and also between 1 and 5. I have noticed that the smaller the max number, the faster the program runs, which is expected due to less data to compute.
